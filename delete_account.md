# Moto Chart - Data Deletion Instructions

**Effective Date:** [Date - e.g., October 26, 2023]

This page explains how you, as a user of the Moto Chart mobile application, can manage and delete the data you have entered into the app.

**Understanding Your Data in Moto Chart:**

All data you input into Moto Chart (including motorcycle details, charging logs, usage statistics, etc.) is **stored exclusively on your local device** within the application's private storage. **We do not collect, store, or have access to this data on any external servers.**

Therefore, "deleting your user profile" or "deleting your account" in the traditional sense (where a central server account is deleted) does not apply directly, as there is no central account managed by us. Instead, data deletion refers to removing the information stored by the app on your specific device.
