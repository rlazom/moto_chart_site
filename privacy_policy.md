# Privacy Policy for Moto Chart

**Effective Date:** [Date - e.g., October 26, 2023]

Makkura ("we," "us," or "our") operates the Moto Chart mobile application (hereinafter referred to as the "Service").

This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.

The data you input into Moto Chart is **stored locally on your device** and is not collected, transmitted, or stored by us on any external servers, unless future features explicitly state otherwise and require your active consent (e.g., a cloud backup feature you opt-in to).

## Information Collection and Use

For a better experience while using our Service, the app requires you to provide certain information. This information is **processed and stored solely on your device**. We do not have access to this information.

The types of information you may input and store locally include:

*   **Motorcycle Information:** Details about your electric motorcycle(s) such as make, model, battery capacity (kWh), an optional photo, and other relevant vehicle identifiers you choose to enter.
*   **Charging Data:** Information related to your motorcycle's charging cycles, such as starting and ending battery percentages, energy added (if provided), cost of charge (optional), odometer readings at the time of charge, and location of charge (if you choose to enter it).
*   **Usage Data:** Kilometers or miles ridden between charges or for specific trips, as entered by you.
*   **Calculated Data:** The Service processes the above data locally on your device to calculate and display statistics like energy consumption (e.g., Wh/km or Wh/mile), estimated range, battery health insights (based on cycles and usage), and overall efficiency.

## How Your Data is Used by the Service (Locally)

The data you provide is used by the Service on your device to:

*   Provide and maintain the core functionality of Moto Chart.
*   Allow you to track and manage your electric motorcycle(s) performance and battery usage.
*   Generate statistics, charts, and insights about your vehicle's usage and battery health, solely for your viewing within the app on your device.
*   Enable you to manage your data within the app (view, edit, delete).

## Data Storage, Security, and Retention

*   **Local Storage:** All the data you enter into Moto Chart, including motorcycle details, charging logs, and usage data, is **stored exclusively on your local device** within the application's private storage (e.g., using SQLite database).
*   **No External Transmission:** We do not transmit this data to any external servers or third parties.
*   **Security:** The security of your data stored locally relies on the security measures of your mobile device (e.g., device passcode, biometric authentication). We recommend you secure your device appropriately. While the app stores data in its private directory, no method of electronic storage on a user's device can be guaranteed to be 100% secure against all threats if the device itself is compromised.
*   **Retention:** Your data is retained on your device as long as you use the Service or until you choose to delete specific data entries or uninstall the application. Uninstalling the application will typically remove all its locally stored data from your device.

## Data Sharing

We **do not share your personal data** with any third parties because all data is stored locally on your device and is not accessible to us.

Future features might include an option for *you* to export your data or back it up (e.g., to your personal cloud storage), but this would always require your explicit consent and direct action.

## Your Data Rights

Since all data is stored locally on your device and managed by you through the Service, you have full control over it:

*   **Right to Access:** You can access all your data at any time within the Moto Chart application on your device.
*   **Right to Rectification:** You can modify or update your data at any time through the app's interface on your device.
*   **Right to Erasure (Deletion):** You can delete individual records or all your data from within the app on your device. Uninstalling the app will also typically remove its locally stored data.

## Children's Privacy

Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13 ("Children"). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. Since the app stores data locally and we do not collect it, this is primarily a notice that the app is not intended for children. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your Child has provided us with Personal Data (e.g., by contacting us via email), please contact us.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the application or on the GitHub repository where this policy is hosted.

You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
